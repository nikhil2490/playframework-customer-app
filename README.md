# Play Java Starter

This is a starter application that shows how Play works.  Please see the documentation at https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Home for more details.

## Running

Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  If you downloaded this project from http://www.playframework.com/download then you'll find a prepackaged version of sbt in the project directory:

```
sbt run
```

And then go to http://localhost:9000 to see the running web application.

## Controllers

There are several demonstration files available in this template.

- CustomerController.java:

- APIs for CRUD operations
 
  GET /customers/:page/				

  PUT /customers/update/				  

  POST /customers/create/			       

  DELETE /customers/delete/:id/
